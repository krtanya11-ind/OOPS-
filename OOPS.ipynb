        "\n",
        "- Abstraction is the concept of hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object or system. It allows you to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation is about bundling the data (variables) and the code (methods) that operate on that data into a single unit—usually a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is often done using access modifiers like private, protected, or public.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder methods in Python (short for \"double underscore\" methods, also known as magic methods or special methods) are special functions that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names — like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are used to define how Python objects behave with built-in functions and operators, and allow you to customize the behavior of your own classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH ?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance is a core concept in OOP that allows a class (called the child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (i.e., attributes and methods) from another class (called the parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps in code reuse, modularity, and establishing a clear hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",

        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It means \"many forms\", and it allows the same operation or method name to behave differently depending on the object that is calling it.\n",

        "\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method that gets automatically called when a new object of a class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object’s attributes (i.e., set up the initial state of the object).\n",

        "\n",
        "-Method Overloading is the concept of defining multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters (number or type). It allows a method to perform different tasks based on how it's called.\n",

        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overriding is a feature in OOP where a child class provides its own version of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the child class to modify or extend the behavior of that method.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different classes, as long as they share a common interface (like having the same method name). This means you can add new classes without changing existing code, making your system easier to extend.\n",

        "Supports Runtime Decision Making\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "Promotes Loose Coupling\n",
